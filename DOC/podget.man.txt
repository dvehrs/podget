EXAMPLE CRON JOB

Once podget is running correctly, it's most useful if you run it from a cron job so that the new episodes are available to play or load onto a portable player and you don't have to wait for them to download.

To edit your crontab, do:

  $ crontab \-e

Then insert one line (i for insert mode), like the following:

  15 04 * * * /usr/bin/podget \-s

This will run podget at 4:15 AM every day.

AUTOMATIC CLEANUP

You can enable automatic cleanup with every run by configuring it in your $HOME/.podget/podgetrc file. Simply set the following options:

  # Autocleanup.
  # 0 == disabled
  # 1 == delete any old content
  cleanup=1

  # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
  # older than this.
  cleanup_days=7

However, some people prefer to run cleanup as a separate cron session. To do that, set the options in podgetrc to:

  # Autocleanup.
  # 0 == disabled
  # 1 == delete any old content
  cleanup=0

  # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
  # older than this.
  cleanup_days=7

And add a cron job to run cleanup, like one of these examples:

  # Once a week on Sunday at 04:15AM
  15 04 * * Sun /usr/bin/podget \-C

SESSION CONTROL

Podget checks for already running sessions when it starts and exits if any are found. Each session requires its own core configuration file, so for multiple sessions simply provide a unique -c <configfile> option for each.

EXAMPLE SERVER LIST

By default, Podget uses $HOME/.podget/serverlist for the default list of servers to contact. However you can configure the name with the config_serverlist variable in your $HOME/.podget/podgetrc file.

The default format is: <url> <category> <name>

NOTES:
  1. URL Rules:
    A. Any spaces in the URL need to be converted to %20
  2. Category Rules:
    A.  Must be one word without spaces.
    B.  You may use underscores and dashes.
    C.  You can insert date substitutions.
        %YY%  ==  Year
        %MM%  ==  Month
        %DD%  ==  Day
  3. Name Rules:
    A.  If you are creating ASX playlists, make sure the feed name does not
        have any spaces in it.
    B.  You can leave the feed name blank, and files will be saved in the category directory.
  4. Disable the downloading of any feed by commenting it out with a #.

HANDLING UTF-16 FEEDS

Some servers provide their feeds in UTF-16 format rather than the more common UTF-8.

To automatically convert these files, create a secondary serverlist at:

        $HOME/.podget/serverlist.utf16

Remember to change the name of the serverlist to match what you set it to with config_serverlist if you changed it.
