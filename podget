# Description:   Podget is a simple bash script to automate the downloading and
#                organizing of podcast content.
# Dependencies:  bash, coreutils, debianutils, findutils, grep, gawk or mawk, libc-bin (for iconv), sed, and wget.
# Installation:  cp podget.sh /usr/local/bin
#                chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/podget.sh                                                                              }}}

#                                   cause "403 Forbidden" errors.
#   -nH                         No host directories (overrides .wgetrc defaults if necessary)
#   --proxy=off                 To disable proxy set by environmental variable http_proxy
#   --no-check-certificate      To disable HTTPS certificate checks.  Useful for sites that may be using self-signed cerficates
#                                   and not those from a trusted service authority.
#   --prefer-family=IPv4/IPv6   When DNS provides a choice of addresses to connect to a host, attempt to connect to the specified
#                                   address family first.  If all addresses of the given family fail then the other family will be
#                                   tried.  If set to 'none' then the addresses will be tried in the order provided by the server
#                                   regardless of which family they are in (this is effectively the default option).
#
#                                   If you wish to force the use of IPv4 addresses only then you can use the "-4" or "--inet4-only"
#                                   options.  Conversely, if you want to force the use of IPv6 addresses then you can set the "-6"
#                                   or "--inet6-only" options.
#   --content-disposition       [EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE] Wget will look for and use "Content-Disposition" headers received from the
#                                   server.  This can result in extra round-trips to the server for a "HEAD" request.  This option
#                                   is useful for servers that use the "Content-Disposition" header to hold the filename of the
#                                   downloaded file rather than appending it to the URL.  This has the potential to make  some of
#                                   Podget's FILENAME_FORMATFIX options unneeded.
#
#                                   WARNING:  Enabling this flag disables any download progress information from being passed on to
#                                   the user.  To debug errors that may occur during sessions with this flag enabled, it may be
#                                   necessary to enable DEBUG and then examine the temporary files that are not deleted in
#                                   DIR_SESSION.
#
#                                   NOTE: This can be enable globally for all feeds here or if you want to enable it for only a few
#                                   specific feeds, you can add "OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION" to their line in your serverlist.
#   --user-agent=<string>           By default Podget will identify itself as "Podget".  If that does not work or you want to
#                                   specify a custom user agent you can do so here.  If the agent is a single word then it does not
#                                   need to be quoted.  If it is a longer string with spaces then it will need to be quoted and have

# When you run podget at a VERBOSITY of 3 or 4, it may appear that the filename format fixes are done out of order.  That is because
# they are named as they are created and as new fixes have been developed, those with more detailed exclusionary conditions have had
# to be done before those with more generic conditions.  Looking for improvements to fix this issue.

# Filename Cleanup 2:  Some RSS Feeds (like the BBC World News Bulletin)

# Filename Cleanup 3: Filenames of feeds hosted by LBC Plus corrupted.
# Fixed per MoonUnit's feature request (#1660764)
#
# Takes an URL that looks like:  http://lbc.audioagain.com/shared/audio/stream.mp3?guid=2007-03/14<...snip>
#                            <snip...>a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# Which normally creates a file named: a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# This fix extracts the date of the episode and changes the filename to 2007-03-14.mp3

# Filename Cleanup 4: Filenames of feeds hosted by CatRadio.cat need fixing.
# Fixed per Oriol Rius's Bug Report (#1744705)
#
# Downloaded filenames look like: 1189153569775.mp3?programa=El+mat%ED+de+Catalunya+R%E0dio&amp;podcast=y
# This fix removes everything after the .mp3
#
# NOTE: Testing in 2017 reveals changes in CatRadio's URL format that hampers this fix.
#
# Downloaded filenames now look like:  1487257264030.mp3&programa=Bon+dia%2C+malparits%21&var10=Neix+%2BCatR%E0dio%2C+el+dial+digital+de+Catalunya+R%E0dio&var11=video&var15=1783&var20=Podcast&var29=Audio&var3=951439&var14=951439&v25=Catalunya+R%E0dio&var19=16/02/17&var12=Tall&var18=45194
#
#   Two changes cause issues:
#     1.  Change of '?' to '&' for designating options.
#     2.  Use of forward slashes in date (var19) mess up some of our other filename extraction.
#
# However the fix for these podcasts is now simpler.  If in our serverlist, we use either
# the OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION or OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSTION option for these feedlists then the
# filename will be correctly extracted.  This leaves us with a long number as the filename,
# however if we also enable the OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE option then the filename is prefixed
# with the last modification date of the file which helps list the files in an order that
# makes sense.

            #     Digraphs may not be included in the locale that you have configured.  On my test systems,
            #     I found that I had one that did not display the correct characters for the digraphs
            #     but rather replaced them all with an underscore character.  The function worked but
            #     it did not display the characters correctly.
            #
            #     On the systems where it did display correctly, I found that I had the following
            #     configuration in my /etc/default/locale:
            #            #  File generated by update-locale

            #     On the one system that did not display correctly, the configuration I had
            #     in /etc/default/locale was:
            #            #  File generated by update-locale
            #            LANG="en_US"
            #
            #      This can be updated by modifying the file or by running:
            #             update-locale LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
            #
            #      This may or may not require a reboot to take effect but I took the easy way out and
            #      rebooted so I would be sure it displayed as I hoped in the future.

            #      NOTE ON CHARACTERS TO CONSIDER NOT INCLUDING:
            #        It is probably a good idea to not include any character that has special meaning
            #        in Bash and needs to be escaped.  That is why this string primarily starts with
            #        digraphs and then includes a few characters that are commonly found on most
            #        keyboards.  I initially wanted to include the $ symbol with the other monetary
            #        symbols.  However I had to escape it or it could cause an "unbound variable"
            #        error on some systems.
            #
            #      NOTE ON CHARACTERS TO CONSIDER INCLUDING:
            #        We are using this character to parse the WGET_BASEOPTS string and put it's parts
            #        into the WGET_OPTIONS array.  To make things as easy as possible, we want to use
            #        characters that are unlikely to be used in any of the WGET options.  This can be a
            #        bit tricky for some options like passwords or user-agent that can take almost
            #        anything.  For that reason, I have included a large selection of digraphs and a
            #        few characters that do not require escaping because it is very unlikely that
            #        someone used them all for one of those options and we will be able to safely
            #        find one to use.
