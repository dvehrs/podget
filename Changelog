  * Small cleanup, removed old bit that had been commented out but without
    explanation.  Thanks to Francois Marier for the pull request on Github.
  * Replaced use of expr statements so that we could enable 'set -o errtrace'.
    These were replaced with bash test regex statements ( [[ =~ ]] ).
  * Added increased debugging options (xtrace, verbosity and/or functrace).
  * Converted many "DEBUG --*" statements to "INFO --" for easier access and
    clarity.

podget (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Ludovic Bellière (xrogaan on Github) for reporting an issue with
    duplicate logging to the completed and errors log when using the recent
    option, a second issue with potential user confusion when marking files as
    already downloaded (also because of recent option) because we used the URL
    filename and not the TITLE of the item when we could, and a third issue
    deleting zero length files when we had modified the filename to remove
    some dangerous characters. All three issues have been fixed.
  * Thanks to Francois Marier for reporting an issue stemming from Wget's
    default user-agent.  Turns out a few feeds are filtering for and denying
    downloads for anything reporting it.  To address this issue, we added three
    options.  First Podget now uses a different user-agent ("Podget") by
    default.  Second, it is now possible to use a longer user-agent to mimic
    common browsers.  And third, there is an option for a single feed to go back
    to using the default Wget user-agent.
  * Thanks to aab3r on Github for reporting an issue with feeds provided by the
    FreshRSS Feed Aggregator.  When they offer a feed for content they have
    already downloaded the media content is not in ENCLOSURE tags but rather in
    MEDIA:CONTENT tags.  We resolved this issue by providing a configuration
    option to enable both tags to be examined for URLs to download.
  * Skipped version 0.9.2 because of a small issue discovered while uploading
    Debian repositories.  Changes consisted of a single character ($) being
    deleted in the WGET_TEST_STRING and a descriptive comment being added.

podget (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Joerg Schiermeier for reporting a bug in our automated cleanup
    loop that occurred when no playlists were found (Debian Bug# 1027121).
  * Added OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG to change name of downloaded file to
    what was specified in the <TITLE> tag from the feed.  Included some basic
    cleanup so it would be friendly to most filesystems.  Updated MAN page to
    include this option.
  * Updated NetBSD and FreeBSD sections of the INSTALL file.
  * Updated checks for MacOS, and the BSDs to check for gtr (GNU Translate).
    The BSD version of tr was having some issues with feeds from countries that
    did not use single byte character sets.  The GNU version does it from a
    single byte perspective so is not affected by the same issue and happens to
    be a bit faster to run.
  * Thanks to Bobabadabouskie (on Github) for reporting an issue with how Podget
    was handling podcast liveItem tags.  And thanks to Adam Curry (adamc199 on
    Github) for providing links to the Podcast Namespace specs detailing its
    format.  From this report and data, added a section to the feed filtering
    that ignores any liveItem data that is found because Podget is not
    appropriate for listening to live streams.

podget (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Pariksheet Nanda (omsai on Github) for finding an update for our
    filename cleanups.  They now handle m4a filetypes.
  * Added support for storing configuration files in either $HOME/.podget,
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/podget, or $HOME/.config/podget so that we are more in
	alignment with the XDG Base Directory Specification. Thanks to jeffgazso
	(on Github) for reporting the issue.
  * During command line option parsing, added "|| :" to second shift for some
    options to bypass error generated when option was last on a line with no
	value specified.
  * Fixed quoting of a few unset commands to address Shellcheck SC2184
  * Added quotes inside a ${} variable to prevent pattern matching, addressing
    Shellcheck SC2295

    Thanks to Kevin Wisher (kwisher on Github) for reporting this.
  * Added test for shopt inherit_errexit support to verify that at least Bash
    version 4.4 was installed. Thanks to Jude DaShiell for reporting the issue.
  * Thanks to Eric Cook (llua@gmx.com) for submitting a patch that updated the way
	required GNU applications are called simplifying script support, and added
	support for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
  * On a per feed basis, added option flags to set WGET to disable SSL
    certificate verification and which network address family (IPv4 or IPv6) it
	should prefer when DNS provides a few choices.
  * Updated manpage and moved away from txt2man conversion.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Sat, 17 Oct 2020 12:14:28 -0600

  * Fixed automatic creation of serverlist file so that core configuration
    file was read prior to testing for existence of the file.  Thanks to
    Corin-EU for reporting this issue on Github.
  * Fixed Cleanup Loop to work based on individual file modification times
    from each playlist.  Thanks to StanESmith for reporting this issue on
    Github.
  * Fixed FILENAME_FORMATFIX9 to cleanup one more formatting issue.  Thanks
    to Gerhard Großmann (charakterziffer) for reporting this issue on Github.
  * Converted implicit to explicit escaping in double quoted strings
    (example: '\n' to '\\n')
  * Changed display of "Build OPT_FEED_PLAYLISTs" to only be shown if an
    active feed is configured to use it.
  * Changed display of UTF loop messages from verbosity 3 to debug.
  * Changed ATOM_FILTER statements to not require quotes.

  * Added OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_NEWFIRST and OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_OLDFIRST support to
	serverlist parsing to enable the creation and updating of playlists of
	all items (not just new) for a feed.  Thanks to Capturts for requesting the
	feature on Github and DrAzraelTod for submitting an example for inspiration.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:19:24 -0600

podget (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved feed handling to allow for correct handling of feeds with either
    descending sort order (newest to oldest [DEFAULT]) or ascending  sort
    order (oldest to newest).  Ascending enabled with OPT_FEED_ORDER_ASCENDING
    tag in the serverlist file for the feed.
  * A few new Shellcheck fixes.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Fri, 07 Oct 2016 10:26:41 -0600

podget (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

    Piyush Purushothaman.
  * Thanks to Kevin Wisher for reporting an conflict between errexit being
    enabled and WGet exiting with a 403 error.  Modified function to capture
	the exit status and determine how to proceed based on it.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Tue, 12 Jul 2016 09:10:17 -0600

podget (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Kitcat490 on Github reported that version 0.8 was failing to load new
    configuration files because the tagged version number was not being parsed
    correctly.   Turns out the issue was due to the new version having a two
    number version rather than the three that older versions commonly had.
    Updated the parsing strings to work with 2, 3 or more sections.
  * Cleanup of approximately 28 Shellcheck reported issues.
  * Attempt to make script more readable by replacing use of test '[]' for
    arithmetic comparisons with shell built-in '(())'.
  * Enabled Extended Pattern Matching (shopt -s extglob)
  * Small cleanup of output text.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Wed, 08 Jun 2016 11:01:53 -0600

podget (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to hugh-m on Github for reporting Podget's lack of support for Atom
    feeds and for helping to test our first implementation of a few options
    this new feed type.
  * Added support for Atom feeds along with a few serverlist options
    (ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE, ATOM_FILTER_TYPE, & ATOM_FILTER_LANG)

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Sun, 05 Jun 2016 10:43:09 -0600

podget (0.7.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to angoongo for submitting a report for an unbound variable error.
  * Thanks to Chris for reporting issue that lead to the development of a
    function to prefix filenames with their modification dates
    (OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE).
  * Modified filename renaming to properly respect the force option (--force),
    this affects OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION, OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION,
    OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE, and FILENAME_SUFFIX.
  * Restored modified filename handling immediately around the wget download
    commands.  Fixed a misguided attempt at script cleanup that resulted in
    an error with iTunes feeds reported by Francois Marier.

  * Thanks to Marcus Stollsteimer for submitting corrections to the man pages
    and help text.
  * Thanks to Marcus Stollsteimer for reporting a bug in the REMOVE_URL function
    where we failed to account for a suitable delimiter character in a sed
	statement.  By moving the offending sed statement after our test for
	suitable character the issue was resolved.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Wed, 30 Mar 2016 16:31:11 -0600

podget (0.7.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Filip Szymański for reporting a second unbound variable error.

podget (0.7.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Willem and our friends at Arch for reporting that we had an
    unbound variable error when using the --create-config functions.  Fixed by
	setting a default for DEBUG that can be used at this stage and modified
	later by the value in a users configuration file.
  * General cleanup.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Sat, 19 Mar 2016 06:25:54 -0600

podget (0.7.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Many thanks to Nicolae Lucian Sandor for his work on proving that we can use
    wget's --content-disposition and --server-response flags.  With these enabled,
    we have been able to rename files based on values held in the
    Content-Disposition or Location tags.  Without his inspired ideas these
    updates would not have been possible.
  * Thanks to ael for reporting an unbound variable (BINARY_ICONV).  I changed
    how I was checking for it's installation and didn't catch all the necessary
    updates.
  * Thanks to Francois Marier for reporting a couple issues with the new
    DIRECTORY_CHECK function that had evaded my testing.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Thu, 17 Mar 2016 17:07:36 -0600

podget (0.7.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Many thanks to Filip Szymański for pointing out that while I had updated
    the Podget script to GPLv3, I failed to update the COPYING file included
    in the package.  This was a small but important oversight and it has
    now been corrected.
  * Fixed grep statement in REMOVE_URL to search for '--fixed-strings' so that
    certain characters (like ^) were not interpreted as regular expressions.
  * Added DIRECTORY_CHECK function to verify that none of the characters
    listed in FILENAME_BADCHARS are used in directory names.
  * Updated FILENAME_CHECK to match FILENAME_BADCHARS testing from
    DIRECTORY_CHECK, and made both checks work with variable indirection.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Sun, 08 Nov 2015 14:21:05 -0700

  * Fixed CLEANUP_AND_EXIT function to suppress extra blank line produced
    while in silent mode (verbosity=0).  Thanks to Colin Turner and Brad
    Beyenhof for reporting this issue.

    later successfully download.  Thanks to Luci Sandor for reporting this and
    submitting an idea that grew into this function.

podget (0.7.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed 'Last Modified' from podget header because of conflicts it was
    causing with git and building Debian packages.  Also removed 'Created'
    because it was unneeded.
  * Updated parsing of Feed pages to account for newlines in enclosure tags.
    Thanks to Todd Harbour for the patch.
  * Fixed OPML and Pcast feed imports to disable 'errexit' while running grep
    tests.  Thanks to Jude DaShiell for reporting the issue.
  * Added improved handling for unset --import_opml, --export_opml and
    --import_pcast values.  Thanks again to Jude for reporting the issue.

    Thanks to Willem for pointing out this issue.
  * Patch submitted by Dan Rich for improved removal of extra spaces from
    start or end of a feed name after removing username & password. Used in
    two places. Thanks.
  * Patch submitted by Dan Rich that removed extra '=' when username was added

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Wed, 20 Aug 2014 15:13:56 -0600

podget (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix for --silent.  It was outputting a single black line that needed to be
    suppressed for verbosity < 1.  Thanks to Willem for reporting it.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Mon, 11 Aug 2014 10:26:35 -0600

podget (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted unix2dos statement to a sed statement to reduce dependencies.
  * Added exit statement after configuration files created with --create-config
    to allow the user to adjust the files prior to any actual downloading.
    (Thanks to Willem and our friends at Arch Linux).
  * Added check to see if --create-config was issued with a filename that
    is already in use.  Exited with error that informs the user of their choice
    to delete the old file or use a different name.  (Thanks again to Willem).
  * Updated check for PLAYLIST_NAME. (Thanks again to Willem).
  * Added checks for NO_PLAYLIST.
  * Updated MAN page. (Thanks yet again to Willem).

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Sun, 10 Aug 2014 10:07:16 -0600

podget (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=high

  * Modified configuration file format.  Users will need to update their
    configuration files before continuing use of podget.  If older
    configuration files are detected, podget will automatically exit.
  * Code Cleanup.  Worked to standardize variable naming, etc.
  * Added 'SUFFIX' option to tag all new podcast filenames with a suffix
    to make it easy to run subsequent scripts to modify the newly downloaded
    files.  For example, these scripts may use id3v2 to standardize the genre
    of the files or use mp3gain to normalize the volumes.
  * Enabled shell attributes for errexit, pipefail and nounset.  These should
    help to make a more robust and less error-prone script.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Fri,  8 Aug 2014 08:47:29 -0600

podget (0.6.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new ability to handle authentication for premium podcasts by the
    user adding a couple tags (USER: and PASS:) to the podcast description in
    their serverlist file.  Many thanks to Dan Rich and Stephen Michael Blott
    for their ideas and suggested implementations.  After mixing their ideas
    with the need for backwards compatibility, we've come up with a solution
    that needs more testing but hopefully will work for all.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Mon, 19 May 2014 05:13:30 -0600

podget (0.6.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added default for playlist creation to automatically create playlist unless
    disabled on the command line or in configuration file to resolve bug
	reported by Yuri D'Elia (Debian Bug #742905)
  * Divided creation of configuration directory and files up into three parts
    to provide greater error reporting possibilities.  Expands opportunities
    to use them as well.  (need to expand man page to show how & when)
  * Fixed bug with handling of playlist creation and individual podcast feed
    playlists
  * Added header to podgetrc file that includes version string that can be
    checked to determine if any updates should be applied to it

    date_format, and configuration file parsing.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com> Wed, 26 Mar 2014 10:18:34 -0600

podget (0.6.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved session files to be created and stored in /tmp by default rather than
    the old location ${HOME}/.podget.  Also created dir_session configuration
    file variable so the user can reassign as they desire.
  * Added test for ownership of session files so multiple users can use the
    same session directory and their sessions won't conflict with each other.
  * Fixed so that podget can properly handle spaces in filenames.
  * Include patch by Simon Rutishauser to enable export of the server list as an
    OPML file.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com>  Tue, 17 Aug 2013 16:04:21 -0600

podget (0.6.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated filename format fix checks so that they do not produce an error if
    that fix is not defined in your podgetrc.
  * Created filename_formatfix9 to address issues with the Audioboo feed URL
    format.  Removes "?keyed=true&amp;source=rss" from the enclosure URL.  Tried
    to make the string matches as generic as possible so that it might work for
    other feeds.  Issue submitted on Sourceforge as bug #3609600 by Markus.
    Many thanks!

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com>  Tue,  5 Apr 2013 09:27:01 -0600

podget (0.6.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to default podgetrc contents to further explain the Smodcast fixes.

podget (0.6.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Smodcast issue reported by Stephen (stallmer) on Sourceforge in Bug ID
    3605008.  Created filename format fix that works in conjunction with
    filename_formatfix4 to resolve the issue.
  * Moved all of the filename format fixes but 1 to a new function.  This cleans
    up the main loop making it easier to understand and maintain.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com>  Tue, 29 Mar 2013 14:52:10 -0600

podget (0.6.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to filename_formatfix to correct for feeds that place the name of
    the file to be downloaded in the parameter media_url=.  Issue reported with
    the Radio France feeds by tom-angoumoisin on March 6, 2013
  * Experimenting with order of filename format fixes.  Those with more specific
    exclusionary conditions go first.  More generic last.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com>  Tue, 16 Mar 2013 11:25:10 -0600

podget (0.6.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to filename_formatfix to correct for trailing characters on
    enclosures for the zdf.de podcasts.  Issue submitted by Joerg Schiermeier on
    Jan 20, 2013.  Thanks.
  * Fixed to display of filenames while marking older podcasts as downloaded
    with the --recent option.  Rather than display the current filename for
    each item, it would display the last modified filename repeatedly.  Fixed
    to display the filename of the item being marked as downloaded.
  * Refined the filename_formatfix to correct filenames downloaded from
    Vimcasts.org.  Filename modification is now simpler and easier to
    understand.

 -- Dave Vehrs <dvehrs@gmail.com>  Tue, 30 Jan 2013 08:30:15 -0700

podget (0.6.9) unstable; urgency=low
